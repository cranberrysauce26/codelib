/**
 * rref takes a matrix as input and returns its reduced row echelon form.
 * A matrix is in reduced row echelon form if and only if:
 *
 * 1. If there is a row where every entry is zero, then this row lies below any other row that
 * contains a nonzero entry.
 * 2. The leftmost nonzero entry of a row is equal to 1.
 * 3. The leftmost nonzero entry of a row is the only nonzero entry in its column.
 * 4. Consider any two different leftmost nonzero entries, one located in row i, column j and the
 * other in row s, column j. Then if s > i, t > j.
 *
 * Lemma: For every matrix A, there is a unique matrix B in reduced row echelon form that is row
 * equivalent to A.

/**
 * rref_solve solves the system of linear equations represented by the augmented matrix A,
 * assuming A is in reduced row echelon form.
 *
 * It returns 0 if there are no solutions, 1 if there is a unique solution, and 2 if there are
 * infinite solutions. If there is at least one solution, it stores the answer in x.
 *
 * Each row in the augmented matrix represents an equation. Each column except column n represents
 * a variable. The last column represents the vector of constants y. i.e., Mx = y, where M is A
 * with the last column removed.
 *
 * Definition: A column is free iff it has no leading 1. F is the set of free columns.
 * Definition: A column is dependent iff it is not free. D is the set of dependent columns.
 *
 * Definition: A matrix is consistent iff n is free. (i.e., there is no row of zeroes followed by a
 * constant at the end)
 *
 * Lemma: A solution exists iff the matrix is consistent.
 * Lemma: A consistent matrix has a unique solution iff F is empty. Otherwise there are infinite
 * solutions. Lemma: Index D as d[0] < d[1] < ... < d[|D|-1]. Then the following is a solution: for
 * 0 <= k < n if (k == d[j] for some j) x[k] = A[j][n] else x[k] = 0
